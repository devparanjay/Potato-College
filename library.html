                    Thanks to Professor To, this section shall exist for all posterity and greatness. She is the best, right? This section contains everything from potato Fiction to potato Science to potato Motivation and even more!
                    <br>
                    Professor To makes sure that this section of the library stays updated with all the potato books of all the potato genres.

            Technically students can ask the Potato Library to get any book that they want for the library, but the final decision lays in Professor Po's hands, who is also the librarian of the Potato Library.
